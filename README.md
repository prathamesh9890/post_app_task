# post_app_task
This Flutter project is a functional assignment app that fetches posts from a REST API and displays them in a dynamic list. The app supports offline caching, read-state persistence, per-item timers that pause/resume based on visibility, and detailed post viewing. The project is built using a clean architecture approach with BLoC state management.
